nextnet is a pivot point discovery tool written in Go.

## Download

Binary packages are available [here](https://github.com/hdm/nextnet/releases/latest).

## Install

Most folks should download a compiled binary from the releases page. If you have Go installed, you can build your own binary by running:

```

## Usage

```
Usage: ./nextnet [options] <cidr or ip address> ... <cidr or ip address>

Probes a list of networks for potential pivot points.

Options:

  -h, --help            Show Usage and exit.
  
  -rate int
    	Set the maximum packets per second rate (default 1000)
      
  -version
    	Show the application version
```

### Local Network Discovery
Identify a multi-homed Windows desktop on the local network.

```
$ nextnet 192.168.0.0/24

{"host":"192.168.0.112","port":"137","proto":"udp","probe":"netbios","name":"DESKTOP-H14GTIO","nets":["192.168.10.12","192.168.20.12"],"info":{"domain":"WORKGROUP","hwaddr":"14:dd:a9:e4:10:a0"}}

```

### Fast External Network Scans
Quickly identify multi-homed hosts running Netbios on the internet

```
$ nextnet -rate 10000 114.80.0.0/16 | grep nets
